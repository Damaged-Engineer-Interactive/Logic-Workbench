GateOPort,ID:
 GateIPort,ID

Example:
AND0,0:
 OR0,1

GateOPortID:
 GateIPortOPort,ID:
	GateIPort,ID

Example:
AND0,0:
 OR00,1:
  NAND1,2

How it works (quick explanation):
	Gate defines the GateType
	ID is the Gates ID
	OPort is the output port
	IPort is where the OPort from the parent Gate connects to on the child Gate

How it works (better explanation):
	Port ranges from 0 to however many input nodes there are on a gate
	The parent Gate is decided by whatever gate is one space back and one line before/above the child gate
	The parent Gate is also decided by the ID used

ID: Vector2i

Example:
0: (50,50)

How it works (quick explanation):
	ID is the Gates ID
	Vector2i is the position data

How it works (better explanation):
	The ID is used to select the gate that's getting moved
	The Vector2i positioning is used based off the center of the GraphEdit/Workspace node

What to add:
	Custom Gate metadata
